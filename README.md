This is the path I'm taking to learn Machine Learning from 0
- - [Learn to touch type first to make coding easier](https://www.typingclub.com/) 
- - [Then learn the basics of Python with the free portion of DataQuest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/dashboard)
- - [After the free portion of DataQuest go to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) This is the final step and after this you should be competent in Machine Learning. 
- - I believe anyone can follow this path with a little dedication.
